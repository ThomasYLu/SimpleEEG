## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a simple EEG implementation that can be the basis for future projects. The project will be a fully functional EEG system, including:
1. Convenient electrodes for placement on skin;
2. Robust filter and amplifier circuitry to obtain relevant brain wave signals;
3. A microcontroller to process and buffer data;
4. A connected output display showing collected signals; and
5. Placement on a dedicated PCB and 3D printed enclosure.

## Educational Value Added
1. Learning principles of physiological sensing and biomedical device creation, relevant to the author's career path, <a href="https://ultrasound-lab.beam.vt.edu/">research</a>, and Biomedical Engineering minor.
2. Advancing practical knowledge of active filter design.
3. Gaining experience in digital signal processing and working with discretes samples of real-time, physical data.
4. Working with serial communciation protocols to transfer data from a microcontroller.
5. Developing knowledge of GUIs/display software.
6. Further advanced soldering and PCB design skills, in particular exploring the use of small SMD components and producing a compact PCB.

## Tasks
Milestone 1: Protoboard prototype
- [ ] Research options for electrodes and select optimal choice
- [ ] Iteratively design, build, and test simple amplifying & filtering circuit on a protoboard
- [ ] Achieve data transfer between Arduino and laptop
- [ ] Plot data from Arduino input on laptop software
- [ ] Finish basic solder training, start advanced solder training
Milestone 2: PCB prototype
- [ ] Make necessary improvements to protoboard prototype circuit
- [ ] Explore and implement other display options than laptop display for portability
- [ ] Test everything fully before moving onto the PCB!
- [ ] Design PCB in KiCAD
- [ ] Once ordered and received, solder and assemble
- [ ] Test test test

## Timeline
- Milestone 1: End of March, 2023
- Milestone 2: Early May, 2023
